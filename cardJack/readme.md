A simple java game of Blackjack.
Directions are to press the Draw button to start the game.
The hit me is to get more randomised cards for the player, which just continues even after results are given.
'new game' button refreshes the page to set up a fresh round.

    *Bugs are that is just goes on and draws another card even after results are in, usually in the first press of
    the 'draw' button. 

*Inspired to make such a card game as it was one of the first tutorial I followed learning java on my own prior to this bootcamp.

*Variables/codes have been written in 'Tagalog' words which i found to aid me in further learning coding in general.

*I had cited some references that gave me an idea of how to properly construct some codes as problems arose.

*Most are learned form the JS course here on Class10 such as         declarations, functions, refactoring etc...
    otherwise citations are made from other sources.

*Background photo used in this project is mine and was taken with my phone. 'Insert smiley face'
