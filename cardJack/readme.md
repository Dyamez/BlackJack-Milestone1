Milestone Project 1 by E. Manansala, for JS Class 10.

A simple java game of Blackjack.
Player closest to 21 wins. Going over 21, dealer or player loses.

Directions are to press the 'Hit Me!' button to start the game.
The 'Hit Me!' button is to deal cards for the player, which just continues even after results are given.
'Stay' button reveals the dealers hand.
'new game' button refreshes the page to set up a fresh round.
'mute/unmute' button on the upper top right for sound.
    -All assets loaded when served through local host server by way of vsCode.
    
*Inspired to make such a card game as it was one of the first tutorial I followed learning java on my own prior to this bootcamp.

*Variables/codes have been written in 'Tagalog' words which i found to aid me in further learning coding in general.

*I had cited some references that gave me an idea of how to properly construct some codes as problems arose.

*Most are learned form the JS course here on Class10 such as declarations, functions, refactoring etc...
    otherwise citations are made from other sources.
