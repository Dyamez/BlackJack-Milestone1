*Inspired to make such a card game as it was one of the first tutorial I followed learning java on my own prior to this bootcamp.

*Variables/codes have been written in 'Tagalog' words which i found to aid me in further learning coding in general.

*I had cited some references that gave me an idea of how to properly construct some codes as problems arose.

*Most are learned form the JS course here on Class10 such as         declarations, functions, refactoring etc...
    otherwise citations are made from other sources.

*Background photo used in this project is mine and was taken with my phone. 'Insert smiley face'
